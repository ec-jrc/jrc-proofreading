## Introduction
ProofChem is a one-click productivity macro to automatically detect all chemical formulae in Microsoft Word documents and automatically format each term with the correct subscripts, superscripts, and italics. 
The use-case scenario is that a document owner runs the macro as a final check that all chemical formulae in a manuscript are correctly formatted.
